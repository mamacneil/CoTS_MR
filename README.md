# Mark-recapture Analysis of crown-of-thorns starfish (CoTS)

================

This repository contains code and data used to estimate CoTS detectability on the Great Barrier Reef, used in the draft manuscript:

### Joint estimation of crown of thorns (Acanthaster plancii) densities on the Great Barrier Reef
	M. Aaron MacNeil, Camille Mellin1, Morgan Pratchett, Jessica Hoey, Ken Anthony, Alistair Cheal, Ian Miller, Hugh Sweatman, Zara-Louise Cowan, Sascha Taylor, and Chris Fonnesbeck

**Note**: The original results file [CoTS_MR_results.csv](https://github.com/mamacneil/CoTS_MR/blob/master/CoTS_MR_results.csv) was missing from the original commit; results from a re-run of the model has been repo'd in stead.
